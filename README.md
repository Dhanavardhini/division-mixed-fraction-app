## 🧮 Overview

This app breaks down the division problem **13 ÷ 5** into 3 interactive learning steps:

1. **Grouping Step** – Student selects how many full groups of 5 fit in 13.
2. **Remainder Step** – Visualizes how many apples are left.
3. **Simplify Step** – Displays the final answer as a mixed fraction (e.g. `2 3/5`), with celebration animation.

Each step includes intuitive visual feedback, child-friendly emojis, and engaging transitions.
